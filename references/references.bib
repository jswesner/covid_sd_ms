	abstract = {Background
Mathematical models describing growth kinetics are very important for predicting many biological phenomena such as tumor volume, speed of disease progression, and determination of an optimal radiation and/or chemotherapy schedule. Growth models such as logistic, Gompertz, Richards, and Weibull have been extensively studied and applied to a wide range of medical and biological studies. We introduce a class of three and four parameter models called "hyperbolastic models" for accurately predicting and analyzing self-limited growth behavior that occurs e.g. in tumors. To illustrate the application and utility of these models and to gain a more complete understanding of them, we apply them to two sets of data considered in previously published literature.

Results
The results indicate that volumetric tumor growth follows the principle of hyperbolastic growth model type III, and in both applications at least one of the newly proposed models provides a better fit to the data than the classical models used for comparison.

Conclusion
We have developed a new family of growth models that predict the volumetric growth behavior of multicellular tumor spheroids with a high degree of accuracy. We strongly believe that the family of hyperbolastic models can be a valuable predictive tool in many areas of biomedical and epidemiological research such as cancer or stem cell growth and infectious disease outbreaks.},

	url = {http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.05.15.20102764},
	abstract = {Background: Social distancing policies aimed to limit Covid-19 are gradually being relaxed as nationally reported peaks in incident cases are passed. Population density is an important driver of national incidence rates; however peak incidences in rural regions may lag national figures by several weeks. We aimed to forecast the impact of relaxed social distancing rules on rural North Wales.
Methods: Daily data on the deaths of people with a positive test for Covid-19 were obtained from Public Health Wales and the UK Government. Sigmoidal growth functions were fitted by non-linear least squares and model averaging used to extrapolate mortality over time. The dates of peak mortality incidences for North Wales, Wales and the UK; and the percentage predicted maximum mortality (as of 7th May 2020) were estimated.
Results: The peak daily death rates in Wales and the UK were estimated to have occurred on the 14/04/2020 and 15/04/2020, respectively. For North Wales, this occurred on the 07/05/2020, corresponding to the date of analysis. The number of deaths reported in North Wales represents 31\% of the predicted total cumulative number, compared with 71\% and 60\% for Wales and the UK, respectively.
Conclusion: Policies governing the movement of people in the gradual release from lockdown are likely to impact significantly on areas –principally rural in nature– where cases of Covid-19, deaths and immunity are likely to be much lower than in populated areas. This is particularly difficult to manage across jurisdictions, such as between England and Wales, and in popular holiday destinations.},

In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation.},

Here we show predictable differences in influenza incidence among cities, driven by population size and structure. Weekly incidence data from 603 cities in the United States reveal that epidemics in smaller cities are focused on shorter periods of the influenza season, whereas in larger cities, incidence is more diffuse. Base transmission potential estimated from city-level incidence data is positively correlated with population size and with spatiotemporal organization in population density, indicating a milder response to climate forcing in metropolises. This suggests that urban centers incubate critical chains of transmission outside of peak climatic conditions, altering the spatiotemporal geometry of herd immunity.},

To achieve this aim, it is necessary to use a simulation technique to generate the samples and perform the required comparisons, using varying sample sizes (10, 12, 15, 20, 25, and 30) and models depending on the standard deviation (0.5). It has been shown from the computational results that the Bayes method gives the best estimates.},

	abstract = {The construction of biomass size spectra in aquatic environments suffers from two main problems: (i) it is a labour-intensive process, and (ii) there is a lack of conformity in methodologies. This study evaluates a technique that produces biomass spectra for benthic metazoans from subsamples stratified using a geometric series of nested sieves. The technique was applied to metazoan communities from three sites, two freshwater and one brackish water, on a small river in southern Britain. Random subsamples of animals from each sieve size were measured using image analysis and showed significant differences in body size, as equivalent spherical diameter (ESD), among all but two sieves. There was no significant difference in ESD among sites. Despite the propensity for long thin animals to pass lengthwise through meshes, sieves contained a consistent range of individual body sizes. Mean individual body size and abundance data for each sieve were used to calculate total biomass. These size spectra were consistent with those from previous studies, and it is hoped that this method will encourage the wider application and more rigorous measurement of biomass size spectra in aquatic ecology.},

However, few studies have explored the relationship between community size structure and land use stresses in lotic systems. In the present study, we investigated use of metrics including mean body size, body size range, size diversity, size evenness, and the size spectrum slope as indicators of land use disturbance in streams. We also explored the effects of sampling intensity (one- versus three-pass electrofishing) on these size-based variables. We found significant decreases in size range and diversity with increased urban cover. In contrast, mean body size, size evenness, and size spectrum slopes were unrelated to variation in land use. Fewer than 25\% of samples collected conformed to the power law model predicted for size distributions in aquatic ecosystems. However, increased departure from the power law form was related to agricultural cover and the use of three-pass electrofishing.},

	abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.

Methods We performed a systematic review to gather data on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach we provide distributions for general hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.

Results We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies - four each within and outside China - with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR: 10-19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR: 3-9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5-13) days for China and 7 (4-11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. 

Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.},
